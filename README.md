# Traffic-Signs-Classification

This is a deep learning basic project that is used to classify the traffic signs.
In this project I have used convolution neural network. The project can also classify images that are of less quality which maybe due to snow, fog, dust, very dim light and disorted images. 

The datasets used for this project are taken from kaggle.com.
The model provides 95.68% accuracy with a loss of 0.12

# Steps to Run the project:
1. Download and unzip the dataset for kaggle.
2. Download and run the kntha.ipynb file in jupyter notebook
3. Once the model is saved, run the GUI.ipynb file.


# Future Scope:
1. Add an option to add a camera feature that can do live classification
2. Real-Time application using IoT.
