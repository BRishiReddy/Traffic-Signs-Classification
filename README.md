# Traffic-Signs-Classification

This is a deep learning basic project that is used to classify the traffic signs.
In this project I have used convolution neural network. The project can also classify images that are disorted due to snow, fog, dust, very dim light or no proper maintenance.

The datasets used for this project are taken from kaggle.com.
The model provides 95.68% accuracy with a loss of 0.12

# Steps to Run the project:
1. Download and unzip the dataset for kaggle.
2. Download and run the kntha.ipynb file in jupyter notebook
3. Once the model is saved, run the GUI.ipynb file.


# Future Scope:
1. Add an option that allows user to use a camera that can classify the images in live.
2. Real-Time application using IoT.
